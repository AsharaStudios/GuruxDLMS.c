This directory is intended for project header files.

A header file is a file containing C declarations and macro definitions
to be shared between several project source files. You request the use of a
header file in your project source file (C, C++, etc) located in `src` folder
by including it, with the C preprocessing directive `#include'.

```src/main.c

#include "header.h"

int main (void)
{
 ...
}
```

Including a header file produces the same results as copying the header file
into each source file that needs it. Such copying would be time-consuming
and error-prone. With a header file, the related declarations appear
in only one place. If they need to be changed, they can be changed in one
place, and programs that include the header file will automatically use the
new version when next recompiled. The header file eliminates the labor of
finding and changing all the copies as well as the risk that a failure to
find one copy will result in inconsistencies within a program.

In C, the usual convention is to give header files names that end with `.h'.
It is most portable to use only letters, digits, dashes, and underscores in
header file names, and at most one dot.

# Debugging

If you use Visual Studio Code, you can use [Cortex Debug Plugin](https://github.com/Marus/cortex-debug)
for debugging, the configuration may be this (example for TivaC):

```json
  // launch.json (debug launch configurations for VScode)
  // ...
 "configurations": [
        {
            "cwd": "${workspaceRoot}",
            "executable": ".pioenvs/lptm4c1230c3pm/firmware.elf",
            "name": "Debug TivaC",
            "request": "launch",
            "type": "cortex-debug",
            "servertype": "openocd",
            "svdFile": "~/.platformio/platforms/titiva/misc/svd/TM4C1230C3PM.svd",
            "configFiles": [
                "/usr/share/openocd/scripts/board/ek-lm4f120xl.cfg"
            ]
        },

  // ...
```

You need openOCD and arm-none-eabi-gdb installed; 
but if you use PlatformIO you can use the PIO packages changing the default path in the plugin:

first install openOCD and arm-none-eabi-gdb packages:
```bash
$ ~/.platformio/penv/bin/platformio platform install --with-package tool-openocd titiva
```

then, configure Cortex Debug Plugin to include custom path for executables:
```json
    // setting.json (Visual Studio Code user configurations).
    // ...
    "cortex-debug.armToolchainPath": "~/.platformio/packages/toolchain-gccarmnoneeabi/bin",
    "cortex-debug.openocdPath": "~/.platformio/packages/tool-openocd/bin/openocd"
    // ...
```
