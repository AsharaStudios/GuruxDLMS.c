We are updating documentation on Gurux web page. 

Read should read [DLMS/COSEM FAQ](http://www.gurux.org/index.php?q=DLMSCOSEMFAQ) first to get started. Read Instructions for making your own [meter reading application](http://www.gurux.org/index.php?q=DLMSIntro) or build own 
DLMS/COSEM [meter/simulator/proxy](http://www.gurux.org/index.php?q=OwnDLMSMeter).

If you have problems you can ask your questions in Gurux [Forum](http://www.gurux.org/forum).

Before start you need to copy src and include folders from development folder here.

For you to begin working, are needed an IDE that has support to PlatformIO such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) or [Atom](https://atom.io/), with the respective PlatformIO plugin installed.
